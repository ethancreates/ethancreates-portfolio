      third: `Currently the website is 90% done, only reason why it's still on going is because there are 2 case studies missing to complete the site, but she has taken a small hiatus from it due to having the need to move from Puerto Rico, back to the US. Once she's finished with the case studies and sends me the data, the site and project should be finished after a weekend or two.`,

Coupled with Tailwind CSS for styling, Framer Motion for animations, React-Hook-Table&Form, & lastly Shadcn-UI as an unstyled component library.`,
      second: `Sadly the project got axed due to internal issues. Personally, I was devastated as I was highly motivated to finish the project. Recently I finished not only the front-end but the backend as well with my new found knowledge. I used Prisma as an ORM and Postgres for the database. You can view it at my projects section.`,
